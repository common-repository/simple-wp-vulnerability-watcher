In today's digital world, it's critical to keep your website secure, especially when running multiple plugins and themes that can expose your site to vulnerabilities. Our plugin is designed to make security monitoring effortless by providing real-time, automated vulnerability scanning.

With **Simple WP Vulnerability Watcher**, you can easily perform thorough checks on all installed plugins, themes, and WordPress core to detect any known security risks. The plugin pulls data from trusted vulnerability databases to ensure you have the latest information at your fingertips. Whether you’re a developer managing multiple websites or a business owner wanting peace of mind, this plugin helps you stay ahead of security issues.

**Key Features:**

**External Services:**

**Simple WP Vulnerability Watcher** uses an external service, [WP Vulnerability](https://www.wpvulnerability.net/), to retrieve information about the latest vulnerabilities related to plugins, themes, and the WordPress core. We want to emphasize that no data is sent from your WordPress installation. The API is contacted solely to download information regarding current vulnerabilities, and this information is then locally compared against your installed plugins, themes, and WordPress core.

To reiterate, no data is being sent anywhere, and the only request made is a GET request.

**Why Security Matters:**

Vulnerabilities in outdated plugins and themes are one of the most common entry points for hackers. By identifying and addressing these weaknesses before they can be exploited, you drastically reduce the risk of attacks, data breaches, and downtime. Your website is the face of your brand—don’t let it be compromised by poor security practices.
